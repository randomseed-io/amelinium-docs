  "Role-based access maintaining middleware. Uses the function associated with
  `:handler` configuration key (`handler` by default) to process roles information.
  This handler is wrapped in memoizer function to cache the results and passed as a
  first argument to `inject-roles` responsible for putting role information into
  request map.

  So the workflow is:
  - For each request `inject-roles` is called.
  - `inject-roles` extracts session object from the request and calls `get-roles-from-session`.
  - `get-roles-from-session` calls handler on user ID (obtained from the session).
  - `get-roles-from-session` adds anonymous role if the user ID could not be obtained.
  - If there is user ID the handler is called from within `get-roles-from-session`.
  - Handler gets user ID and calls a function under configuration key `:query-roles-fn`.
  - The result of querying the database is a sequence of maps.
  - The maps are parsed with `parse-roles`.
  - The result of `parse-roles` is a map with (context -> sets of roles).
  - The result is returned to `inject-roles` and injected into a request map.

  Additionally, configuration option `:req-context-fn` can specify an alternative
  function which will be called within `inject-roles` to get context from the request.

  One can also use `:req-self-role-fn` to provide a function used to get an identifier
  of a self-role (only when user is authenticated) on a basis of the request map."
