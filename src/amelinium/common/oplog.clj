;; Initialization

(defn init!
  "Initializes operations logging by starting a separate thread listening for log
  messages on a channel which is shared with a generated reporting function using
  lexical closure.

  The writer (`:writer`) should be a function taking the following arguments:
  `id` (will be used to pass a configuration key `k`), `db` (will be used to pass a
  database connection (a data source), if set under `:db` configuration key),
  `table` (will be set to a table name, if set under the `:table` configuration key),
  `messages` (will be set to a queue of messages to be written). If there is no
  `:writer` option given in the configuration map, the initializer will try to find
  one by using `k` with a string `-writer` attached (and the converted to a
  symbol).

  The reporter (`:reporter`) should be a function taking the following arguments:
  `id` (will be used to pass a configuration key `k`), `channel` (will be used to
  pass a channel for sending messages to the listening thread), `message` (will be
  used to pass a message. The responsibility for handling the message is delegated to
  the writer function, with the exception that a message cannot be nil (such messages
  should be ignored).

  A call of the reporter function is wrapped into anonymous function which closes
  over initialized `k` and `channel` values, providing the call with two first
  arguments. This new function is exposed under `:fn/reporter` configuration key
  associated by the initializer within a returned map.

  So, if no `:reporter` nor `:writer` is set in configuration, and the configuration
  key is `:amelinium.common.oplog.auth/log` then the defaults would be:
  `amelinium.common.oplog.auth/log-reporter` (reporting) and
  `amelinium.common.oplog.auth/log-writer` (writing). Both must be defined."
